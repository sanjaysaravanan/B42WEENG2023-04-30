Database:
  A database is an organized collection of structured/unstructured information, or data, 
  typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually 
  controlled by a database management system (DBMS).

  SQL --> Structured Query Language
    Language used to structurallly query the database, database responds with data

  Eg: Design a DB for Facebook sort of application,
    Data invovled in facebook, 
      what are the groups of data that being used in Facebook,
        1. Users ---> id, Profile Picture, Name, DOB, BIO
        2. Friends ---> User Id, email, friend_since, frind_id
        3. Posts ---> post_id, vidoe/image, likes (number), comments( this is also group )
        4. Comments ---> user_id, datetime, string
        5. Ads --> name, image, link, genre of the ads

  Relationship between tables/objects,
    one-to-many (user ---> friends)
    many-to-one (friends ---> user)

  Eg:
    School/College maintaining students/teachers data in structured manner 
    like below,
      Student:
        student_id ( int )
        student_name (  )
        student_class/year
        student_department
        class_teacher (teacher_id)
      Teacher:
        teacher_id
        teacher_name
        teacher_subject
      Subjects:
        name
        id (primary key)
        teacher ( teacher_id ) ( FOREIGN KEY )
      Marks:
        subject_id ( FOREIGN KEY )
        mark
        mark_id (primary key)
        student_id ( FOREIGN KEY )

      Relationship between the teacher and student,
        teacher ---> students (one to many)
      
      Subjects & Teacher,
        teacher ---> subjects
      
      Marks and Subjects:
        Marks --> subjects, students (many to many)

    Train Ticket Booking,
      Train:
        train_number
        train_name
        train_status
      Customers:
        cust_id
        cust_name
        cust_email
        cust_phone
      Bookings: (Tickets)
        pnr
        customer_id
        seats
        tain_number
        date
  
  Exercise Design a DB for Shopping Mart including,
    Customers, Products, Orders related Cart_id/customer_id (), Cart ( multiple entries of product with same cart_id )

Storing these information in structural( SQL ) / Un Structural( NoSQL ) way
is called a database.

DBMS:
  Database Management System is a software application/service used to 
  manage the operations( CRUD ) in the DB.

MySql:
  MySQL is a Structural database management system.

MySql Engine:
  A storage engine is a software module that a database management system uses 
  to create, read, update data from a database.

basics:
  datatypes in sql
    basic types 
      varchar(size) - string, 
      INT(size), 
      FLOAT(size, d), 
      DATE
      BLOB(size) / TEXT (CDN URL)- images/vidoes
        usually not suggested to used because of the uncertain size and type of the media which can load the DB size.
        Preferred way is CDN ( Content Delivery Network ) which can serve the images or videos hover internet

create DB
  https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp
  syntax: CREATE DATABASE databasename;

  Eg: Create Data base for School Management

  CREATE DATABASE school-mgmt;

list DB;

create table

  rows(inserted, updated, deleted) ( data ), columns(alter) ( specification of the type of data )

  https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_create_table.asp

  CREATE TABLE table_name (
      column1 datatype,
      column2 datatype,
      column3 datatype,
    ....
  );

  CREATE TABLE Students (
    StudentId int,
    LastName varchar(255),
    FirstName varchar(255),
    Class int,
  );

ALTER TABLE:
  statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.
  ALTER TABLE table_name
  ADD column_name datatype;

  ALTER TABLE table_name
  DROP COLUMN column_name;

  ALTER TABLE table_name
  RENAME COLUMN old_name to new_name;

  ALTER TABLE table_name
  MODIFY COLUMN column_name datatype;

CRUD --> CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE

READ:
  select:
    all data
      SELECT * FROM movies;

    single column
      SELECT title FROM movies;

    multiple columns
      SELECT title, director FROM movies;

  Filtering:
    where:
      select movies from year 1995
      select movies except with ids 1, 5, 8
      select the movies which contains WALL in titl string

  Sorting:
    order by:
      select * from movies order by Title asc/desc;
    limit:
      order and limit the enteries
    offset:
      where to start the limit count

  distinct:
    without duplicate
    list all directors in alphbetical

  aggregate function:
    max, sum, min, count

  alias:
    as syntax to convert the column name

  group by:
    aggregate function by combing row with condition
    Reference: https://sqlbolt.com/lesson/select_queries_with_aggregates

CREATE:
  insert:
    INSERT INTO tablename
    (column, another_column, …)
    VALUES (value_or_expr, another_value_or_expr, …),
          (value_or_expr_2, another_value_or_expr_2, …),
          …;

UPDATE:
  UPDATE mytable
  SET column = value_or_expr, 
      other_column = another_value_or_expr, 
      …
  WHERE condition;

  change director for a movie

  update movies set Director='John Lasseter' where Title="A Bug's Life";

Relation between Multiple Tables
  Students:
    student_name
    student_id
    class_teacher
  
  Marks:
    subject_id
    subject_name
    student_id
    subject_marks

  Teachers:
    teacher_id
    teacher_name

DELETE:
  DELETE FROM mytable
  WHERE condition;

Task Design:
  Degin a DB for IMDB

Desing the DB Tables and Realtionships like belwo,

Movies (
  id INT,
  title TEXT,
  ...
);
Genre (
  id INT,
  movie_id INT,
  ...
);

Movie --> Many Genres
